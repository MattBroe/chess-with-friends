# chess-with-friends
A website made in Django where people can play chess against one another.


After cloning the repo, you have to set the SECRET_KEY setting in chess_with_friends/settings.py to a 50-character random string. 

To try it out by yourself, run the local server, visit the homepage on two different web browsers (or two windows of the same browser, one of them in incognito mode) so that you can create and be logged into two accounts at once. Click the "start a new game button" in both windows and start playing. 

Thanks to the creators of Chessboard.js and Chess.js, which this project uses.
