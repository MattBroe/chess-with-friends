# chess-with-friends
A website made in Django where people can play chess against one another.


After cloning the repo, you have to set the SECRET_KEY setting in chess_with_friends/settings.py to a 50-character random string. 

Thanks to the creators of Chessboard.js and Chess.js, which this project uses.
